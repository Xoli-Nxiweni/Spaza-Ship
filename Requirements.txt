To tackle this project efficiently within a 24-hour time limit, letâ€™s break down the tasks into prioritized steps with strict time estimates. 

### 1. **Backend Setup (Node.js + MongoDB)**
   - **Objective**: Create a foundational RESTful API with authentication, product management, and database integration.
   - **Time Allocation**: 6 hours

   #### Steps:
   - **Project Setup (30 mins)**: Initialize a Node.js project with Express, Mongoose (MongoDB ODM), and JWT for authentication.
   - **User Authentication (1.5 hours)**: Set up user model, registration, and login routes with JWT-based authentication.
   - **Product Management API (2.5 hours)**: 
     - **Endpoints**: Create endpoints for adding, updating, deleting, hiding, and listing products.
     - **Product Model**: Define schema fields like name, price, availability, description.
   - **Cart and Checkout API (1 hour)**: Design endpoints for cart management, such as adding/removing items, and basic checkout logic.
   - **API Documentation (30 mins)**: Write up README or Swagger documentation covering all endpoints for quick reference.

### 2. **Frontend Setup (React.js + Redux)**
   - **Objective**: Build a responsive web interface that interacts with the backend API, including user authentication and product listing.
   - **Time Allocation**: 8 hours

   #### Steps:
   - **Project Setup (30 mins)**: Initialize React app, set up routing, and install dependencies like Redux and Axios.
   - **Authentication (1.5 hours)**:
     - **Login and Registration Pages**: Create forms for registration and login.
     - **API Integration**: Implement login and registration using Axios to call backend authentication endpoints.
   - **Product Listing (2 hours)**:
     - **Listing Page**: Display products with filtering or search options.
     - **API Integration**: Fetch product data from backend and display it.
   - **Product Management (1.5 hours)**:
     - **Add Product Form**: Create a form to add new products (if the user is an admin or seller).
     - **Update/Delete Product Functionality**: Enable product updates and deletion.
   - **Cart and Checkout (1 hour)**:
     - **Cart Component**: Design a basic cart interface for users to add/remove products.
     - **Checkout Page**: Basic checkout form and API integration.
   - **UX Touches (30 mins)**: Style and make responsive. Add feedback messages for errors or successful actions.

### 3. **Deployment**
   - **Objective**: Host both the backend and frontend for testing and final submission.
   - **Time Allocation**: 3 hours

   #### Steps:
   - **Backend Deployment (1.5 hours)**: Deploy backend API on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, Render) and ensure MongoDB database connection.
   - **Frontend Deployment (1 hour)**: Host the React app on a platform like Vercel or Netlify, connecting it to the backend API.
   - **Testing and Debugging (30 mins)**: Test live environment and fix any deployment-specific issues.

### 4. **Final Documentation & Submission**
   - **Objective**: Ensure the project is well-documented and ready for submission.
   - **Time Allocation**: 1 hour

   #### Steps:
   - **Write Documentation**: Describe setup, usage, API endpoints, and deployment instructions.
   - **Code Review and Cleanup**: Ensure code is clean, organized, and well-commented.
   - **Final Commit and Push**: Ensure the latest version is on GitHub/Bitbucket and ready for submission.

### Suggested Timeline (24 Hours Total):
1. **Backend Setup** (6 hours)
2. **Frontend Development** (8 hours)
3. **Deployment** (3 hours)
4. **Final Documentation & Submission** (1 hour)
