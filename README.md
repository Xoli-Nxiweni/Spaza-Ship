## Project Overview

The **CodeTribe Marketplace MVP** is a full-stack application developed to showcase essential e-commerce features. The backend was built with Node.js and MongoDB, handling authentication, product management, and cart functionalities. The frontend, developed with React, provides a user-friendly interface for browsing, managing, and purchasing products.

## Features

### Backend
- **User Authentication**: Register and log in with JWT authentication.
- **Product Management**: CRUD operations for products, including adding, updating, deleting, hiding, and viewing product listings.
- **Cart and Checkout**: Add items to cart and proceed to checkout.

### Frontend
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **User Registration and Login**: Secure forms for user authentication.
- **Product Listing**: Browse available products, with options to filter and search.
- **Add a Product**: For sellers to list new products.
- **Update/Delete Product**: Manage product availability and details.
- **Cart and Checkout**: Add products to cart and proceed to checkout.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT for authentication
- **Frontend**: React.js, Redux for state management, Axios for API requests
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Deployment**: Hosted on platforms (e.g., Heroku for backend, Vercel/Netlify for frontend)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- NPM or Yarn

### Backend Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SpazaHub.git
   cd SpazaHub/backend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Set up a `.env` file in the `backend` folder with the following variables:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. **Run the Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   Your backend server should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` folder with the following variable:
   ```env
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

4. **Run the Frontend**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
